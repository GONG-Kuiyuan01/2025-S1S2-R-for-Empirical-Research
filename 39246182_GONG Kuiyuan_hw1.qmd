Homework 1

Full name: GONG Kuiyuan

Preferred name: Eddie

ID: 39-246182

# Introduction

My name is GONG Kuiyuan. I come from China and I probably come from a very different department from other students, which is the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics. The reason why I choose to take this course is to confront the kind of "fear" of coding and programming in my mind because I have been using Stata ever since I entered university. Yes, I am the spoiled kid who uses Stata a lot! During the winter break, I tried to learn LaTex myself and found that coding wasn't that scary, which is the tipping point that makes me here. Therefore, I really hope that I can learn and master a lot from this course.

Here is a photo of me:

Please check out the location of [my hometown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongshan){target="_blank"} and [my Linkedin](https://x.com/chiitan7407?lang=en){target="_blank"} page (even though there is nothing here).

## My hometown

My hometown is located in the South China. This city is small compared with other cities in China. The fun fact is that my hometown was named by a very famous politician who was born there and named "Sun Yat-sen", my hometown wouldn’t have become a city but a county if it weren’t for him.

## What I want to learn

-   The correct way of data cleaning and processing. I have been using Excel and Stata to process my data, but those steps were barely recorded. I want to make eveything more transparent.

-   I heard that R is also quite similar with Python and I am learning these two languages at the same time. I hope this course can help to foster a sort of mentality of coding that I can apply to other computer language.

-   Using terminals to manipulate R and Python seems to be very cool for me. Therefore, I truly expect to also learn something about the use of terminals like VS code.

Homework tasks

1.  Include a photo of yourself (instead of chiitan). **Finished!**

2.  Write an introduction of yourself and explain why you are interested in the course. **Finished!**

3.  Write a small description of where you are from and include a link to your hometown either on Wikipedia or Google maps (or both!). **Finished!**

4.  Uses `-` to make a list of 3 things you hope to learn in this course. **Finished!**

5.  Write a bit of R code: define a variable, print it, etc. Anything. Just get some practice including R code in your homework. **Finished!**

To compile your quarto document, you need to install package `quarto` and then you compile your `.qmd` file using the `quarto_render()` function. Be sure to follow the specified file naming convention.

# More practice

An example quarto document. This is my thesis. My research question is blah, blah, blah. There is a relationship between `mpg` and `disp`.

```         
lm(mpg ~ disp,dplyr::filter(mtcars,mpg!=8))
```

Use a blank link between paragraphs. You can use a bit of **bold** or *italics*.

Use backticks to indicate `code` that will be rendered in monospace.

Here's a list:

-   an item in the list
-   another item
-   yet another item

You can add latex to write equations. $$
y_i = \alpha_0 + \beta_0X_i + \beta_1 Contol_i + \epsilon_i
$$

You can include blocks of code using three backticks:

```{r}
n <- 200
x <- 1000
x*n

y <- x*n
length(y)

s <- c(n, x, y)
length(s)

s <- s/2
print(s)
```

You can also include inline code say the mean of `x`, `r mean(x)`, or the length --\> of `x`, `r length(x)`. If you add an `r` to the beginning of the backticks it will actually run the code, otherwise it just puts it in code case.

`r mean(x)` `r length(x)` `r x*y`

It'll figure out numbered lists, too:

1.  First item
2.  Second item

And it's easy to create links, like to a list of [CRAN Packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html){target="_blank"}.
